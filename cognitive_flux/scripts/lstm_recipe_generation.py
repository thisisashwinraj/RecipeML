This module contains the class for long short term memory (LSTM) RNN based recipe 
generation. The classes offer methods for generating recipe text, validating LSTM 
results, & enhancing the consistency of recipe titles, ingredients & instructions.

Depending on individual cases, the program may be modified to use multiprocessing 
capailities to increase the speed of data processing, on eligible local computers.
The usage of each class & their methods are described in corresponding docstrings.
